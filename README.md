**DOWNLOAD AND EXTRACT ALL FILES:**

Open maps folder and replace all map related files in your client, located in the maps folder, or make a new folder within /maps and place there. You can then select it in game.

Open Resources folder and replace all resources related in your client, located in the Resources folder.

Overwrite all files in your main client directory with the remaining files from the main downloaded folders.

**Remove/delete bazaar.eqg from your client** - make backups if desired. This server uses the old bazaar, so we do not need this file.

Any further server updates to dbstr, Resources, BaseData, and spells will be uploaded to Discord.
